When applied to the ‘main’ method, it means that the method cannot be overridden by any subclass. However, since the ‘main’ method is ‘static’, it belongs to the class rather than an instance, and it's not inherited in the usual way. As a result, the use of ‘final’ here is more of a formality and has no significant effect on the functionality of the ‘main’ method.");
